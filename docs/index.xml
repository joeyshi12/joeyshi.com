      <description>I spent the past few days attempting to convert an old Aspire One mini laptop and Lenovo laptop into usable Linux servers. This post documents the troubleshooting steps I took for each system.
Aspire One The important things to note about this system is that it has a 32-bit architecture and an i686 processor. Some of the compatible distros I considered installing were Arch Linux, Debian, and Linux Mint.
During the installation process for Arch Linux and Debian, my network interface was not detected, which made it annoying to discover available networks to connect to.</description>

      <description>A collection of custom made tools for programming tasks or challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered.
Website Source code Webhook debugger The webhook debugger page lists the contents of requests captured from the /webhook/capture endpoint. This feature was inspired by a cross-site scripting CTF challenge I attempted. This tool is also useful for inspecting request contents from webhook service providers, such as Discord or Github.
JSON Schema Transcompiler This service is a wrapper for a Python library I wrote: jdtt.</description>

      <description>Wiki for laptops and desktops with technical details and reviews. This was a group project done for a UBC computer science course: CPSC 304.
Website ER Diagram This is a fullstack web application that was originally made with Java, MySQL, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The web server was implemented using Javalin.
I later redesigned the frontend to use Angular and setup my Raspberry Pi to be able to run this application in a Docker container.</description>

      <description>In my final year at UBC, I decided to typeset notes for some of my courses.
Website Source code To make some of these notes publicly available, I used the following workflow to convert a collection of markdown notes into HTML pages using Pandoc.

      <description>A desktop application that uses the finite difference method to solve differential equations.
PyPI Page Source code This application uses techniques from these lecture notes to compute the solution of PDEs numerically.
Numerical algorithm for solving the heat equation We let $u(t, x)$ be the solution function for the differential equation defined by
$$ \begin{align} \text{PDE}:\quad &amp;amp;u_{t}(t, x) = \alpha u_{xx}(t, x) + S(t, x), 0 &amp;lt; x \leq L, 0 &amp;lt; t \leq T \\ \text{BC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(t, 0) = \Phi_1(t),\quad u_{t}(t, L) = \Phi_2(t) \\ \text{IC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(0, x) = f(x) \end{align} $$</description>

      <description>Real-time multiplayer browser platformer made with p5.
Game Website Source code This was primarily made using TypeScript and various browser APIs.
Image processing The first API I leveraged was the canvas scripting API, which offered useful image processing functions. To start using this feature, I added a canvas element in my main HTML template file
1 &amp;lt;canvas id=&amp;#34;game&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/canvas&amp;gt; Then, I get the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface from this element in a separate script.</description>

      <description>A visualization for understanding the distribution of salaries of workers in the tech industry. This project was something I worked on with a group while taking CPSC 447 at UBC.

      <title>Extending the Fibonacci sequence to the Real Domain</title>
      <link>https://joeyshi.xyz/posts/extending_fibonacci/</link>

      <description>The Fibonacci sequence can be written out as $0, 1, 1, 2, 3,\dots$, where the following terms is defined by the sum of the 2 previous terms. Letting $f(n)$ denote the $n$-th term of the sequence, we can write this as $f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n)$ with initial values $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$.
Finding a closed formula To find a closed formula for this sequence, we can use the classic Characteristic Root Technique from discrete mathematics.</description>
