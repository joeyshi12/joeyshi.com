      <description>In the past week and a half, I&amp;rsquo;ve invested some time learning rigging and animation inside Blender. I&amp;rsquo;ve published some of the scenes I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a separate website, where I used three.js to render everything.&#xA;Website Source code Custom emotes Lethal Company - Doug Walker meme I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded a video render of this scene on Youtube here.</description>

      <description>A collection of custom-made tools for programming tasks or challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered.&#xA;Website Source code Webhook tester The webhook tester page allows users to capture requests sent to /webhook/&amp;lt;webhook_id&amp;gt;/capture and displays the contents. This feature was inspired by a cross-site scripting CTF challenge I attempted. This tool is useful for inspecting request contents from webhook service providers, such as Discord or Github.&#xA;DNS visualizer A DNS lookup visualization tool for tracing the search path for an iterative query.</description>

      <description>Wiki for laptops and desktops with technical details and reviews. This was a group project done for a UBC computer science course: CPSC 304.&#xA;Website ER Diagram This is a fullstack web application that was originally made with Java, MySQL, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The web server was implemented using Javalin.&#xA;I later redesigned the frontend to use Angular and setup my Raspberry Pi to be able to run this application in a Docker container.</description>

      <description>A desktop application that uses the finite difference method to solve differential equations.&#xA;PyPI Page Source code This application uses techniques from these lecture notes to compute the solution of PDEs numerically.&#xA;Numerical algorithm for solving the heat equation We let $u(t, x)$ be the solution function for the differential equation defined by&#xA;$$ \begin{align} \text{PDE}:\quad &amp;amp;u_{t}(t, x) = \alpha u_{xx}(t, x) + S(t, x), 0 &amp;lt; x \leq L, 0 &amp;lt; t \leq T \\ \text{BC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(t, 0) = \Phi_1(t),\quad u_{t}(t, L) = \Phi_2(t) \\ \text{IC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(0, x) = f(x) \end{align} $$</description>

      <description>A collection of web games I made and host.&#xA;Game Website Platform Party - A real-time multiplayer 2D platformer. Snake - The classic snake game with a high-score board. Source code These games were made primarily using TypeScript and the HTML5 canvas API.&#xA;Image processing The first API I leveraged was the canvas scripting API, which offered useful image processing functions. To start using this feature, I added a canvas element in my main HTML template file</description>
