      <description>A collection of custom made tools for programming tasks or challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered.
Website Source code Webhook debugger The webhook debugger page lists the contents of requests captured from the /webhook/capture endpoint. This feature was inspired by a cross-site scripting CTF challenge I attempted. This tool is also useful for inspecting request contents from webhook service providers, such as Discord or Github.
JSON Schema Transcompiler This service is a wrapper for a Python library I wrote: jdtt.</description>

      <description>Wiki for laptops and desktops with technical details and reviews. This was a group project done for a UBC computer science course: CPSC 304.
Website ER Diagram This is a fullstack web application that was originally made with Java, MySQL, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The web server was implemented using Javalin.
I later redesigned the frontend to use Angular and setup my Raspberry Pi to be able to run this application in a Docker container.</description>

      <description>In my final year at UBC, I decided to typeset notes for some of my courses.
Website Source code To make some of these notes publicly available, I used the following workflow to convert a collection of markdown notes into HTML pages using Pandoc.

      <description>A desktop application that uses the finite difference method to solve differential equations.
PyPI Page Source code This application uses techniques from these lecture notes to compute the solution of PDEs numerically.
Numerical algorithm for solving the heat equation We let $u(t, x)$ be the solution function for the differential equation defined by
$$ \begin{align} \text{PDE}:\quad &amp;amp;u_{t}(t, x) = \alpha u_{xx}(t, x) + S(t, x), 0 &amp;lt; x \leq L, 0 &amp;lt; t \leq T \\ \text{BC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(t, 0) = \Phi_1(t),\quad u_{t}(t, L) = \Phi_2(t) \\ \text{IC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(0, x) = f(x) \end{align} $$</description>

      <description>Real-time multiplayer browser platformer made with p5.
Game Website Source code This was primarily made using TypeScript and various browser APIs.
Image processing The first API I leveraged was the canvas scripting API, which offered useful image processing functions. To start using this feature, I added a canvas element in my main HTML template file
1 &amp;lt;canvas id=&amp;#34;game&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/canvas&amp;gt; Then, I get the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface from this element in a separate script.</description>

      <description>A visualization for understanding the distribution of salaries of workers in the tech industry. This project was something I worked on with a group while taking CPSC 447 at UBC.
Visualization Write-up Source code Data Dictionary The following data was processed from Salaries for Jobs in Data Science and Tech:
Attribute Type Cardinality/Range company Categorical 1631 title Categorical 15 basesalary Quantitative [0, 1659870] yearsofexperience Quantitative [0, 69] yearsatcompany Quantitative [0, 69] location Categorical 1050 This dataset consists of tech salary information from North America recorded in the time between January 1st, 2019 and September 9th, 2020.</description>
