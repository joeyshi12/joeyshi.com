      <description>Self-hosting is a convenient skill to have for anyone: it allows you set up personal VPNs, cloud services, and more. As a developer, I find they&amp;rsquo;re useful for cheaply serving my web app projects over the internet. I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing my workflow for serving web applications in this post.&#xA;Setting up the Host Machine We first choose our host machine: a computer that we want to use as our server. An easy choice to start off with is a Raspberry Pi, which is a single-board basic personal computer.</description>

      <description>I spent the past few days attempting to convert an old Aspire One mini laptop and Lenovo laptop into usable Linux servers. This post documents the troubleshooting steps I took for each system.&#xA;Aspire One The important things to note about this system is that it has a 32-bit architecture and an i686 processor. Some of the compatible distros I considered installing were Arch Linux, Debian, and Linux Mint.&#xA;During the installation process for Arch Linux and Debian, my network interface was not detected, which made it annoying to discover available networks to connect to.</description>

      <description>The Fibonacci sequence can be written out as $0, 1, 1, 2, 3,\dots$, where the following terms is defined by the sum of the 2 previous terms. Letting $f(n)$ denote the $n$-th term of the sequence, we can write this as $f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n)$ with initial values $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$.&#xA;Finding a closed formula To find a closed formula for this sequence, we can use the classic Characteristic Root Technique from discrete mathematics.</description>
