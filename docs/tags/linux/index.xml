      <description>I spent the past few days attempting to convert an old Aspire One mini laptop and Lenovo laptop into usable Linux servers. This post documents the troubleshooting steps I took for each system.
Aspire One The important things to note about this system is that it has a 32-bit architecture and a i686 processor. Some of the compatible distros I considered installing were Arch Linux, Debian, and Linux Mint.
During the installation process during Arch Linux and Debian, I noticed that my network interface was not detected, which made it impossible to discover available networks to connect to.</description>
