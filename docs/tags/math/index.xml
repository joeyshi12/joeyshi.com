      <description>A desktop application that uses the finite difference method to solve differential equations.
Source code This application uses techniques from these lecture notes to compute the solution of PDEs numerically.
Numerical algorithm for solving the heat equation We let $u(t, x)$ be the solution function for the differential equation defined by
$u_{t}(t, x) = \alpha u_{xx}(t, x) + S(t, x)$, $0 &amp;lt; x \leq L$, $0 &amp;lt; t \leq T$ $u(t, 0) = \Phi_1(t)$ $u_{t}(t, L) = \Phi_2(t)$ $u(0, x) = f(x)$ Let $u[i][j] = u(i \Delta t, j \Delta x)$ for $i = 0$ to $i = K - 1$ and $j = 0$ to $j = N - 1$ for $\Delta t = T / (K - 1)$ and $\Delta x = L / (N - 1)$.</description>

      <title>Extending the Fibonacci sequence to the Complex Domain</title>

      <description>The Fibonacci sequence can be written out as $0, 1, 1, 2, 3,\dots$, where the following terms is defined by the sum of the 2 previous terms. Letting $f(n)$ denote the $n$-th term of the sequence, we can write this as $f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n)$ with initial values $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$.
Finding a closed formula To find a closed formula for this sequence, we can use the classic Characteristic Root Technique from discrete mathematics.</description>
