      <description>This post will describe how panning and zooming can be implemented in an application.&#xA;Points can be described in world space or screen space. The world space is a linear basis that describes where objects in the world are positioned while the screen space is a basis that is used to describe points relative to the screen that the world is being drawn over.&#xA;When panning or zooming on the screen, a different translation and scale is being applied to the screen coordinates to determine how and what slice of the world should be drawn on the screen.</description>

      <description>Self-hosting is a convenient skill to have for anyone: it allows you set up personal VPNs, cloud services, and more. As a developer, I find they&amp;rsquo;re useful for cheaply serving my web app projects over the internet. I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing my workflow for serving web applications in this post.&#xA;Setting up the Host Machine We first choose our host machine: a computer that we want to use as our server. An easy choice to start off with is a Raspberry Pi, which is a single-board basic personal computer.</description>

      <description>I spent the past few days attempting to convert an old Aspire One mini laptop and Lenovo laptop into usable Linux servers. This post documents the troubleshooting steps I took for each system.&#xA;Aspire One The important things to note about this system is that it has a 32-bit architecture and an i686 processor. Some of the compatible distros I considered installing were Arch Linux, Debian, and Linux Mint.&#xA;During the installation process for Arch Linux and Debian, my network interface was not detected, which made it annoying to discover available networks to connect to.</description>

      <description>A collection of custom-made tools for programming tasks or challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered.&#xA;Website Source code Webhook tester The webhook tester page allows users to capture requests sent to /webhook/&amp;lt;webhook_id&amp;gt;/capture and displays the contents. This feature was inspired by a cross-site scripting CTF challenge I attempted. This tool is useful for inspecting request contents from webhook service providers, such as Discord or Github.&#xA;DNS visualizer A DNS lookup visualization tool for tracing the search path for an iterative query.</description>

      <description>A desktop application that uses the finite difference method to solve differential equations.&#xA;PyPI Page Source code This application uses techniques from these lecture notes to compute the solution of PDEs numerically.&#xA;Numerical algorithm for solving the heat equation We let $u(t, x)$ be the solution function for the differential equation defined by&#xA;$$ \begin{align} \text{PDE}:\quad &amp;amp;u_{t}(t, x) = \alpha u_{xx}(t, x) + S(t, x), 0 &amp;lt; x \leq L, 0 &amp;lt; t \leq T \\ \text{BC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(t, 0) = \Phi_1(t),\quad u_{t}(t, L) = \Phi_2(t) \\ \text{IC}:\quad &amp;amp;u(0, x) = f(x) \end{align} $$</description>
