title: "Joey Shi - Software Developer"
---

Hello ðŸ‘‹. I'm a professional full-stack developer @ [Visier](https://www.visier.com/).

I work on interactive dataflow visualization libraries and various HCM data extractors.
In my role, I have helped drive many different projects,
delivered impactful feature demos to the company, and mentored new developers.

Outside of work, I enjoy tinkering with different kinds of software and learning new things.
Most personal coding projects I invest my time in are motivated by the goals of
learning a new piece of technology or exploring new use cases of familiar technology.
You can find some of my works listed [here](/projects/).

Feel free to connect! I'm always up for discussions about productivity tools,
computer graphics, and Linux ricing (I use Arch and Neovim btw).
