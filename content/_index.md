Hello! I'm a software developer and BSc student majoring in Computer Science and Math at the University of British Columbia.

As a developer of many projects, I tackle challenging problems head-on.
My experiences with using unfamiliar tools have made me a versatile problem-solver. I consider myself to be a reliable and efficient team member.

I interned as a Full-Stack Software Developer at Visier from January 2021 to December 2021.
During my time here, I contributed in feature-development and fixed bugs following Agile principles.
I focused on test-driven development, communicated across different teams, hooked up demos for company-wide presentations, and mentored new interns.

Academically, I am committed to my education and excel in my studies with an A+ average.
Outside of class, I enjoy finding new ways to optimize my Arch Linux developer environment dotfiles.
